# reversi_game
Code Kata for playing the game of Reversi. 

The challenge is to write a program that takes the current board position as input, and returns a board showing the legal moves available for the current player. The challenge does not involve creating a playable game.

The rules/requirements of the challenge are here - https://codingdojo.org/kata/Reversi/

The result of the challenge currently looks like this, with one input and one output board
